2. APIs are aligned with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in database management. GET = Read, POST =  Create, PUT = Update, DELETE = Delete.
It is scalable and improves client and server interactions and it also works with different browsers and clients. It is also consistent and it is standardised.
