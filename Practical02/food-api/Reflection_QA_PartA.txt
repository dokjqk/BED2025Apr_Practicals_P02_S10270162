During Part A of the practical, I learned how REST APIs allow communication between client and server using standard HTTP methods. I gained a clearer understanding of how GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE are used to implement CRUD operations.

Why use POST for creating resources and PUT for updating?
POST is used to create resources because it allows the server to generate a new resource with a unique identifier. PUT is used for updating because it always gives the same result, even if you send the request more than once. This makes it a good choice when you want to make sure the data is updated in a consistent way.

What status code should be returned when attempting to update a non-existent resource?
The status code is 404 Not Found.
